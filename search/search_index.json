My research was on Hydrothermal synthesis of rare earth nanomaterials and the rare earth photo-functional nanoparticles applied in biochemistry as bio-optical marker. And I had completed these studies: 2018/10\uff0c The morphology, structure and luminescence properties of YPO4: Eu3+\uff0c Sm3+ 2018/11\uff0c The effects of different pH values on the structure and luminescence properties of YPO4:Eu3+ and YPO4:Sm3+ 2018/12\uff0c The effects of different PO4-/RE3+ ratios on the structure and luminescence properties of YPO4: Eu3+, Sm3+ 2018/12\uff0c The effects of different temperatures on the structure and luminescence properties of YPO4: Eu3+, Sm3+ 2019/02\uff0cThe interaction between Dy(III) / Rutin complex and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) 2019/03\uff0c Molecular docking between Dy(III) / Rutin complex and BSA 2019/04\uff0c XRD refinement of YPO4: Sm3+ Papers which based on these studies are being written and will be published in the near future. With the application of nanoparticles in medical field, it is of great importance to investigate the interaction of nanoparticles and protein molecules in bioinorganic chemistry. Due to the special electronic configuration and a variety of electronic energy levels of rare earth ions, rare-earth-doped nano-luminescent materials have unique optical, electronic and magnetic characteristics. That caused rare-earth-doped nano-luminescent materials has potential applications in biomarker, medical imaging, drug carrier and other fields. However, unique properties make rare earth ions are not friendly to be characterized. Such as: some rare earth elements are difficult to be characterized by NMR; some rare earth's effects are difficult to explain with mature theories. On the other hand, some limitations exist the rare-earth-doped nano-luminescent materials such as water-solubility, biocompatibility and molecular mechanism, etc. Therefore, characterize the complexes of rare earth and proteins and establish the relationship among surface property-luminescent property-biomolecule are difficult at the molecule level. Based on my current research work and other publications which reported the similar research works. The addition of rare earth elements has a great influence on the atomic vibration frequency induced by light scattering, which makes some of the original frequencies disappear and contributes to the selective absorption of spectral bands. And this kind of influence has certain regularity, which is consistent with the Lanthanide contraction. This means that the mode of action of rare earth elements can be well studied by spectroscopy, especially vibration spectroscopy. This April\uff082019/04\uff09, I visited Assoc. Prof. Yuko S. Yamamoto\u2019s lab at JAIST. She is doing research on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), there are many SERS equipment in her lab. I got an idea there that SERS will be useful for the analysis of rareearth doped nano-luminescent materials/proteins complexes. SERS can obtain enhanced Raman signals at the molecular level and is widely used in biochemistry. Therefore, I hope I\u2019ll start new research of this theme in Yamamoto lab at JAIST. In my research plan at JAIST, I\u2019ll start studying rare-earth-doped nano-luminescent materials/proteins complexes by SERS. The purpose of this study is analyzing rare-earth-doped nanoluminescent materials/proteins complexes by SERS then establish the relationship among surface propertyluminescent property-biomolecule. To characterize the structure of this complex, methods of rare earth chemistry which I studied in current university and methods of X-ray diffrection by crystals will be used; analysis of these complexes at the molecular level by using SERS; computer modeling of the possible interaction of this complex based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular docking.

Materials Chemistry Chemical Design and Synthesis of Functionalized Probes for Imaging and Treating Tumor Hypoxia Liu, J. N., Bu, W. B. , and J. L. Shi . \"Chemical Design and Synthesis of Functionalized Probes for Imaging and Treating Tumor Hypoxia.\" Chemical Reviews 9.117(2017):6160-6224. Hypoxia development in tumor is closely associated with its increased aggressiveness and strong resistance to therapy, leading to the poor prognosis in several cancer types. Clinically, invasive oxygen microelectrode and high dosage radiotherapy are often utilized to accurately detect and effectively fight hypoxia. Recently, however, there has been a surge of interdisciplinary research aiming at developing functional molecules and nanomaterials that can be used to noninvasively image and efficiently treat hypoxic tumors. In this review, we will provide an overview of the reports published to date on the imaging and therapy of hypoxic tumors. First, we will present the design concepts and engineering of various hypoxia-responsive probes that can be applied to image hypoxia noninvasively, in an order of fluorescent imaging, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and photoacoustic imaging. Then, we will summarize the up-to-date functional nanomaterials which can be used for the effective treatments of tumor hypoxia. The well-established chemical functions of these elaborately designed nanostructures will enable clinicians to adopt specific treatment concepts by overcoming or even utilizing hypoxia. Finally, challenges and future perspectives facing the researchers in the field will be discussed. Plasmonic enhancement of lanthanides luminescence using metallic nanoparticles Berthelot, A. , et al. \"Plasmonic enhancement of lanthanides luminescence using metallic nanoparticles.\" Optical Components and Materials XI International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2014. This work summarizes how plasmonic phenomena can enhance the fluorescence of lanthanides (Ln3+) coupled to metallic nanoparticles (MNP). Lanthanide-ions emission lines, based on 4f-4f transitions, are weak due to Laporte selection rules for optical transitions. This effect results in low absorption cross sections for excitation and long lifetimes for emission processes. We propose to use metallic nanoparticles in order to determine how plasmonic nanoparticles can enhance absorption and emission of two emblematic lanthanides ions used for bio-labeling and energy conversion, i.e., Eu3+ and Er3+. This work quantifies the average enhancement factor (AEF) is expected for different geometries of nanoparticle structures and compares it to previous studies. Then, we theoretically and numerically investigate metal-enhanced fluorescence of plasmonic core\u2013shell nanoparticles doped with lanthanides ions. The shape and size of the particles are engineered to maximize the average enhancement factor of the overall doped shell. We show with theoretical considerations and numerical studies that the highest enhancement (11 in the visible and 7 in the near-infrared) is achieved by tuning either the dipolar or the quadrupolar particle resonance to the rare-earth ion\u2019s excitation wavelength. Additionally, the calculated AEFs are compared to experimental data reported in the literature, obtained under similar conditions (plasmon-mediated enhancement) or when a metal\u2013Ln3+ energy-transfer mechanism is involved. Metal enhanced fluorescence in rare earth doped plasmonic core\u2013shell nanoparticles S Derom et al. \"Metal enhanced fluorescence in rare earth doped plasmonic core\u2013shell nanoparticles\" Nanotechnology 24(2013):495704 Metal enhanced spectroscopies rely on excitation and/or emission enhancement by coupling emitters to a plasmonic particle. This has been extensively studied, notably for tip or surface-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS/SERS) or dye \ufb02uorescence enhancement. In practice, the highest signal enhancement is achieved for low initial absorption cross-section and quantum yield, since both the excitation and the emission processes are enhanced. Sun et al described SERS as photoluminescence enhancement in the limit of null initial absorption cross-section and quantum yield. Therefore, SERS presents the highest enhancement (up to 106) whereas MEF is typically of a few tens only. Nevertheless there sults achieved for dye molecule scan not be directly transposed to rare earth ions which present extremely low absorption cross-sections but quantum ef\ufb01ciencies close to unity, in contrast to dyes which present high absorption cross-sections and generally lower quantum ef\ufb01ciencies. In addition,it is worth while to note that lanthanide luminescence is also extremely sensitive to the surroundings so that identifying the role of plasmons is a dif\ufb01cult task. A large number of works, mainly experimental, but also theoretical, have been realized in order to probe the possibility to enhance the optical properties of rare earth ion splaced near metal nanoparticles .Some recent works have highlighted that gold or silver metal nanoparticles could change the selection rules of rare earth ion emission, but the localized plasmon contribution remains under discussion. Indeed, it is very dif\ufb01cult to separate the respective roles of plasmons and energy transfer in the observed enhancement.
