Use Japan Standard Time (UTC +9 ) in general, except using China Standard Time(UTC +8) during some winter or summer vacations(when I go back to my hometown). Want to learn something about computer science during the spare time, but never started so far. An ACGN lover(especially galgame) The times/hours I like to work/study My classes/research works start at 9AM so I have to begin my study at that time. I do not want to spent too much time for lunch because I eat everything slowly. I will try my best to finish all my intense tasks before 5PM. Reading books at night is needed, as long as I could finished all tasks during the day. Ideally I will have a dayoff on Saturday. The best way to communicate with me I do not like using IM, you could communicate with me via E-mail. E-mail address: chnliefeng@gmail.com I turn off notifications while working, studying and sleeping, so I will response as soon as possible when I receive emails. Although I'd like to make friends with various people, I prefer receiving precise (and hopefully interesting) questions or topics. I may not reply to something abstract or monotonous just because I have no idea what should I reply : ( Things I need Network Silent environment At least 9 hours of working per day At least 1 hours of reading per day Things I struggle with Not good at communicating with others Self-hatred without reasons Mild procrastination(but not mild for me) Things I love Being alone but not feeling lonely Technical knowledge Writing blog/wiki Other things about me Thin, short and ugly INTJ-A (Yes,I am 2%) Nostalgia Who I love \u535a\u9e97\u3000\u970a\u5922\uff08\u306f\u304f\u308c\u3044 \u308c\u3044\u3080\uff0cHakurei Reimu\uff09","title":"about"},{"location":"about/about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/about/#about-me","text":"Is a international student studying in Japan, major in Material Science & Spectroscopy.
